# github-actions-pipeline

The goal of this project was to gain a basic understanding of github actions. This project auto-generates comments on issues created in this repository. One of the comments is generated through a community action, the other is generated through the Github API. 

### How to run
Run `npm install` in the webapp folder, then `npm run dev` 

### **Tools Used:**
* `React` For rendering jsx elements and creating UI
* `Npm` Package management and frontend server management
* `Vite` Unit testing and running the React server (as opposed to using "Create React App")
* `GithubActions` Automation and CI/CD Pipeline management


Basic workflow for auto-generating comments as a reaction to comments and github api usage:
