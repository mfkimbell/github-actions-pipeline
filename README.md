# github-actions-pipeline

The goal of this project was to gain a basic understanding of github actions. This project auto-generates comments on issues created in this repository. One of the comments is generated through a community action, the other is generated through the Github API. 

I plan to add more to this project in the future.

Here we have added a "GitHub Workflow Dispatch" to manually run tests when needed:
